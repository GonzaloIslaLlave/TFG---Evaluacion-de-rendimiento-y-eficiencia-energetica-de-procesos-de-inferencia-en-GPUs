[04/21/2024-04:57:49] [TRT] [W] Check verbose logs for the list of affected weights.
[04/21/2024-04:57:49] [TRT] [W] - 41 weights are affected by this issue: Detected subnormal FP16 values.
[04/21/2024-04:57:49] [TRT] [W] - 24 weights are affected by this issue: Detected values less than smallest positive FP16 subnormal value and converted them to the FP16 minimum subnormalized value.
