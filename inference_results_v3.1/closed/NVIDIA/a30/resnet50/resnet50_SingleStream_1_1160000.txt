[04/13/2024-05:11:38] [TRT] [I] The profiling verbosity was set to ProfilingVerbosity::kLAYER_NAMES_ONLY when the engine was built, so only the layer names will be returned. Rebuild the engine with ProfilingVerbosity::kDETAILED to get more verbose layer information.

MLPerf Results Summary
================================================
SUT name : LWIS_Server
Scenario : SingleStream
Mode     : PerformanceOnly
90th percentile latency (ns) : 496609
Result is : INVALID
  Min duration satisfied : NO
  Min queries satisfied : Yes
  Early stopping satisfied: Yes
Recommendations:
 * Decrease the expected latency so the loadgen pre-generates more queries.
Early Stopping Result:
 * Processed at least 64 queries (103450).
 * Would discard 10119 highest latency queries.
 * Early stopping 90th percentile estimate: 496648
 * Early stopping 99th percentile estimate: 501136
