MLPerf Results Summary
================================================
SUT name : LWIS_Server
Scenario : Offline
Mode     : PerformanceOnly
Samples per second: 8105.44
Result is : INVALID
  Min duration satisfied : NO
  Min queries satisfied : Yes
  Early stopping satisfied: Yes
Recommendations:
 * Increase expected QPS so the loadgen pre-generates a larger (coalesced) query.
