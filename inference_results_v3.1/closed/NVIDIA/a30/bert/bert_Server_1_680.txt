MLPerf Results Summary
================================================
SUT name : BERT SERVER
Scenario : Server
Mode     : PerformanceOnly
Scheduled samples per second : 678.89
Result is : INVALID
  Performance constraints satisfied : NO
  Min duration satisfied : Yes
  Min queries satisfied : Yes
  Early stopping satisfied: NO
Recommendations:
 * Reduce target QPS to improve latency.
Early Stopping Result:
 * Run unsuccessful.
 * Processed 407338 queries.
 * Would need to run at least 40438374 more queries,
 with the run being successful if every additional
 query were under latency.
